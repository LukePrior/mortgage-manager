# Mortgage Manager

## Overview

Mortgage Manager is an open-source online home-loan comparison tool using product data from the Consumer Data Standards Banking APIs. Authorised deposit-taking institutions are obligated to provide information on the products that they offer via a set of APIs defined by a standardised set of specifications allowing for machine processing. The individual institutions are responsible for hosting and mainting their respective APIs so to get an overview of all products offered in Australia I expanded my Open Banking Tracker which downloads all product information daily and publishes it to GitHub to also include an overview file for home-loans specififcally which is used to generate the main table in Mortgage Manager. This overview file is designed to be as small as possible so that it can quickly be downloaded which means that not all information for each product is included. This is resolved by manually downloading the entire product information also from my Open Banking Tracker repository when the details panel is opened
